My name is Konrad Krasowski and I'm a Java Developer with growing interest in front-end technologies. I'm in the process of switching my career to IT, while developing new skills through continues learning, engaging with the community of developers and building my projects.

  More details about me

<br >

From the moment I have printed "Hello World" in my console, I knew I got the bug that would keep me hooked forever!
That little spark has started something, which very quickly has become my number one focus, worth re-organizing my whole life around. Leaving a successful career in banking was not an easy decision to make, but I like ambitious goals and know how to achieve them. I am convinced that this is the best way to grow as a person!

Apart from tech, I'm very passionate about travelling and healthy lifestyle. My biggest adventures was an 8-month solo backpacking trip around South East Asia and Australia and climbing Thorong La Pass, Nepal (5416m). I love cooking, especially when putting a healthy spin on my favourite cuisines - Italian and Asian.
