### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

From the moment I have printed "Hello World" in my console, I knew I got the bug that would keep me hooked forever!
That little spark has started something, which very quickly has become my number one focus, worth re-organizing my whole life around.
Now I'm in the process of switching my career to IT, while developing new skills through continues learning, engaging with the community of developers and building my projects.

- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on an app connecting people intrested in learning languages from native speakers.
- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently expanding my knowlegde in Java, Spring, JS, React, SQL/NoSQL, Docker.
- ðŸ‘¯  Iâ€™m looking for an opportunity to get some commercial experience as a software developer.
- ðŸ¤”  Iâ€™m looking for help with securing my first position in IT.
- ðŸ’¬  Ask me about anything related to the technologies mentioned above or travelling ðŸ§­.
- ðŸ“«  How to reach me: krasy8@gmail.com
- âš¡  Fun fact: I love travelling, spent 8 months backpacking through South East Asia and Australia, climbed Thorong La Pass, Nepal (5416m).
