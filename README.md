  More details about me
</summary>

<br >

From the moment I have printed "Hello World" in my console, I knew I got the bug that would keep me hooked forever!
That little spark has started something, which very quickly has become my number one focus, worth re-organizing my whole life around. Leaving a successful career in banking was not an easy decision to make, but I like ambitious goals and know how to achieve them. I am convinced that this is the best way to grow as a person!

Apart from tech, I'm very passionate about travelling and fitness. I run, cycle, work out and cook healthy - when your body is taken care of, your brain follows suit üí™üèª üòé.
